# Insurance Cost Regression (Neural Networks)

Regression modeling project to predict individual medical insurance costs based on demographic and health-related features. The dataset consists of 1,137 observations and six input features, and the task is solved as a supervised learning regression problem using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Implemented using Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview:
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and data quality issues
- Cleaned and preprocessed data including outlier handling, missing value imputation, scaling, and encoding
- Built and tuned multiple neural network regression models using TensorFlow/Keras
- Selected the best-performing model based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Applied the trained model and preprocessing pipeline to unseen data and presented project findings during a live project demonstration 

## Tools:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
